-- Break operating income into NII vs non-NII (fees + trading) for each bank-year,
-- then compute NII mix % and rank banks by NII dependency in 2024.
-- Joins kpis (NII) against income_statement (operating income line) to avoid
-- double-counting; shows multi-CTE pipeline and cross-table JOIN.
-- Shows: multi-CTE, JOIN across two tables, window function on CTE result.
